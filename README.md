# 🧠 Text Visualizer

### 📘 Design and Analysis of Algorithms – Visualization Project

Welcome to the **Text Algorithm Visualizer**, an educational frontend project crafted to simulate and visualize algorithmic logic interactively — perfect for understanding how decision-making flows in real time.

Built using:

* **React.js**
* **HTML5 + JSX**
* **CSS3**
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**

> Designed for clarity and learning, this tool is ideal for students diving into algorithm visualization and component-based web architecture.
